# DriftGame

Hi

Ran on Python 3 version 3.9.12 64-bit ( windows store) 

Code written on VScode

You don't have to do anything fancy to run it. However:
  Pygame will have to be imported
  You have to change the directory path for the following lines of code for your own system. They look like this 
    pygame.image.load("vscodeproj/img/track.png")  
    mixer.music.load("vscodeproj\Sounds\Background-Song.wav")
    Acceleration_Sound = mixer.Sound("vscodeproj\Sounds\Acceleration.wav")
    
    DIRECTORY PATH OF THE IMAGES AND SOUNDS HAS TO BE CHANGED FOR YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER OR IT WILL NOT RUN
     DIRECTORY PATH OF THE IMAGES AND SOUNDS HAS TO BE CHANGED FOR YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER OR IT WILL NOT RUN
      DIRECTORY PATH OF THE IMAGES AND SOUNDS HAS TO BE CHANGED FOR YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER OR IT WILL NOT RUN

If you want to exit the game just click anywhere on the screen 
  (I created a line of code to do just that) 

That's about it. :D:D
